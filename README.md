# Multi-Scale Mobility Anomaly Detection

## Overview

This project analyzes human mobility patterns during normal and emergency periods using the YJMob100K dataset. We discovered something surprising: people actually become MORE predictable during emergencies, not more chaotic as commonly assumed.

## Key Findings

**Main Discovery**: During emergencies, daily behavior patterns become more structured while individual activities show only small increases in irregularity.

**Numbers That Matter**:
- Daily anomaly rates DECREASED from 8.2% to 7.4% during emergencies
- Individual trip anomalies increased slightly from 10.5% to 10.9%
- People delayed their daily start times by about 1 hour
- Spatial coverage reduced by 69% - people stuck to familiar places
- Social activities increased from 7.2% to 10.6%
- Dining and shopping activities decreased by 3-4%

## Analysis Periods

- **Normal Period**: Days 0-60 (business as usual)
- **Emergency Period**: Days 61-75 (crisis response)

## Applications

- Emergency response analysis
- Urban mobility modeling  
- Behavioral pattern detection
- Location recommendation
- Anomaly detection

## Methods Used

**Two-Level Analysis**:
- Subset Level: Looking at individual trips and activities  
- Daily Level: Looking at complete daily behavior patterns

**Hidden Markov Models**: We identified 4 behavioral states:
- Routine: Regular daily activities
- Social: Meeting people and social activities  
- Crisis: Emergency-related behavior
- Exploration: Trying new places or activities

**Text Conversion**: We can convert movement data into readable sentences like:
"During Tuesday afternoon at 12:30, the user visited a Japanese restaurant in a high-density urban area and engaged in dining activities."

## How People Adapted During Emergency

**Where They Went**:
- 52% of usual locations were abandoned
- Only 7% new locations were explored
- People concentrated in central areas (40% to 60%)
- Avoided outer areas (dropped from 25% to 5%)

**When They Moved**:
- Started daily activities 1 hour later on average
- Peak activity time stayed the same (5:00 PM)
- Morning activities (6-9 AM) decreased significantly
- Late morning activities (11 AM-1 PM) increased

**What They Did**:
- Less dining out and shopping
- More social visits and essential services
- More focused on support and connectivity activities

## Individual Differences

**Most People (79%)**: Made moderate adjustments to their routines
**Some People (21%)**: Made extreme changes to their behavior

Example: One person's irregularity increased by 33%, completely changing from routine behavior to highly exploratory patterns.

## Why This Matters

**For Emergency Planning**:
- Resources should be concentrated in central, familiar areas
- Services can be scheduled around delayed start times  
- Plan for increased social support needs

**For Understanding Human Behavior**:
- Crises don't create chaos - they create structure
- People prioritize familiar places and essential connections
- Individual responses vary greatly even in the same emergency

## Technical Implementation

**Programming**: Python with standard data science libraries
**Models**: Hidden Markov Models for behavioral state detection

**Validation**: Compared multiple detection methods

**Performance**: 
- Processing time: 44 seconds per person

4. **Real Applications**: Useful for emergency response and urban planning

## Getting Started

1. Download the YJMob100K dataset
2. Install Python with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
3. Run the main analysis script starting from 1. POI to fucntional region file -> Grid to 5 datasets -> EDA -> text generation -> complete anomaly execution.
4. Explore individual user patterns and emergency adaptations

## Results Summary

The research challenges the common assumption that emergencies create chaotic behavior. Instead, we found that people become more structured and predictable during crises, concentrating their activities in familiar areas and following more rigid daily routines. This has important implications for how we plan emergency responses and understand human behavior under stress.

## Future Work

- Apply to different types of emergencies and regions
- Develop real-time monitoring systems
- Integrate with other data sources like communications and economic indicators
- Create predictive models for emergency behavior

This work provides the first systematic evidence that emergency behavior is more structured than chaotic, offering new insights for researchers and practical tools for emergency managers and urban planners.
